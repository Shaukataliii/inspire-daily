# How to set up?
Just run the set-as-startup-app.py and it will automatically set the main.py as start up application & that's it.

Now the app will start doing it work.
- Whenever you will turn ON the PC, it will display the quote notification (once/day).
- The app will check if the notification is displayed today or not after the setup duration i.e. 4 hours. So if you're on laptop and you don't turn it OFF, you're still at ease. You'll get a notification every day.
